Flask-Velox
===========

``Flask-Velox`` is a Flask extension designed to provide ready made View and
Mixin  classes to help rapidly build Flask applications for both public and
admin systems, based on Flasks pluggable ``MethodView``.

Here at `SOON_`_ we use Flask a lot and we wanted a framework we could use
across all our products. As our products and requirements grow so
will ``Flask-Velox``. It is early days but the absolute
basics are there and we would love feedback and help to grow this further.
